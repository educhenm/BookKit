BookKit
=======

An experiment with the hope of creating a JavaScript ePub3 rendering engine.

BookKit is not intended to be a stand-along ebook reader, but rather
the rendering engine within the web view of an ebook reader. One could
create an entirely browser-based reader around it, but that is not the
primary goal. BookKit provides hooks to interact with reader
applications.

BookKit is not fully-functional and is not recommended for use.

BookKit is BSD licensed. The third-party libraries and fonts included have their own licenses you should be mindful of.
